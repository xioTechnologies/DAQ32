  Functional description.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





AtOpenLib.

Pascal-style declaration: 

  AtOpenLib : function (Prm : Integer) : Integer; cdecl;

C-style declaration:

  int (__cdecl * AtOpenLib) (int Prm);

It is necessary call this function only once - only after loading DLL into main program.
For dynamic loading of DLL:
call 'LoadLibrary' Windows API function, define a pointer to 'AtOpenLib' by calling 
'GetProcAddress' Windows API function and then call 'AtOpenLib'.
In a case of statically connected DLL just call 'AtOpenLib' once at the start of a program.
'AtOpenLib' function must be called first, before calling any other function exported by
this DLL. If ‘AtOpenLib is called a second time this will cause an error in program.
Note that 'AtOpenLib' is not a main function of DLL and OS will never call it automatically.
Input argument 'Prm' of this function is formal and reserved for future use.
'Prm' can be any value.
If the function works properly - then it returns value of maximal amount of oscilloscope's 
instances which is possible to create using current dynamic-link library.
If the function makes any error - then it returns code of error -1 (minus one).

Before closing a program utilizing oscilloscope DLL its necessary to stop calling
any function of the DLL, destroy all created instances of oscilloscope by 'ScopeDestroy'
DLL function and then unload oscilloscope DLL using 'FreeLibrary' API function
of MS Windows - if it was loaded dynamically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





ScopeCreate.

Pascal-style declaration:

  ScopeCreate : function (Prm : Integer; P_IniName : Pointer; P_IniSuffix : Pointer) : Integer; cdecl;

C-style declaration:

  int (__cdecl * ScopeCreate) (int Prm, char * P_IniName,  char * P_IniSuffix);

This function creates a new instance of the oscilloscope. New instance is initialized completely
and does not require any additional reset. Window (form) of the new instance is invisible.
Call to 'ScopeShow' DLL function to bring new oscilloscope window onto computer screen.

Argument 'Prm' is formal and reserved for future. Can be any value.
Arguments 'P_IniName' and 'P_IniSuffix' are pointers to null-terminated ANSI character's strings.

'P_IniName' is a pointer to the string which is name of 'INI' file describes properties of new
oscilloscope's instance.

If path string contains a character of colon (two-spot - ':') - it will be recognized as the
absolute full path. If path string does not contains a colon character - then the new instance
of oscilloscope will look for its 'INI' file in its own application's folder (directory).

Length of this string must be not longer than 100 characters.
If pointed string has zero length - than oscilloscope will look
for 'INI' file having default name: 'Scope_Desk.ini'. If the file with required name does
not exist - then new oscilloscope will apply to itself default and digestible properties.

'P_IniSuffix' is a pointer to zero-terminated ANSI string containing last characters
of section names. For example:
If it points to zero-length string than new oscilloscope will look for settings
in default [Oscilloscope] and [Miscellaneous] sections of 'INI' file.
If it points to "ABC" string - then new oscilloscope will look for settings
in [Oscilloscope_ABC] and [Miscellaneous_ABC] sections of 'INI' file.
If section having required name does not exist - then new oscilloscope will use the default
and digestible properties. Length of suffix string must not be longer than 100 characters.


Sections explanation:

[Oscilloscope]			- section contains properties of oscilloscope.
OscVrulFontName=Arial		- Font name for vertical ruler digits.
OscVrulFontSize=16		- Font size for vertical ruler digits.
OscVrulFontStyleBold=0		- Bold stage for vertical ruler digits. 
OscVrulFontStyleItalic=0	- Italic stage for vertical ruler digits.
OscBackColor=00000000		- Oscilloscope's screen color.
OscGridColor=00404040		- Oscilloscope's screen grid color.
OscBeam0Color=0000FF00		- Color of first oscilloscope's beam. 
OscBeam1Color=00FF00FF		- Color of second oscilloscope's beam. 
OscBeam2Color=0000FFFF		- Color of third oscilloscope's beam. 
OscVrulGenFontColor=000000FF	- Color of vertical ruler's digits when this valid for all beams.
OscHorScaleColor=000000FF	- Color of text in field, found on the upper left corner of oscilloscope's graphical field:
				  it displays horizontal sample signal resolution in one cell of the main oscilloscope's
				  graphical field marking grid. In other words, it displays the horizontal sweep speed.
OscZeroLineColor=00808080	- Color of zero horizontal line of oscilloscope's screen grid color.
ShowSecondBeam=1		- Second beam visible (if is one) or invisible (if is zero).
ShowThirdBeam=1			- Third beam visible (if is one) or invisible (if is zero).
OscOscCaption=Oscilloscope	- String of basic caption of oscilloscope's window (form).
ShowTestButton=1		- Button of test/performance measurement visible (if there is one) or invisible (if is zero).
BfrSmplSize=500000		- Size (in signal's samples) of FIFO for every created beam (channel).
BuffersRecordType=1		- Type of created FIFO element: if it is 1 - type is double floating, 0 - single floating.
CreateSecondBeam=1		- If it is not zero - creates second beam and allocates memory for its FIFO buffer,
				  otherwise - does not.
CreateThirdBeam=1		- If it is not zero - creates third beam and allocates memory for its FIFO buffer,
				  otherwise - does not.
SpreadViewTiming=1		- If it is not zero - inserts insignificant random delay into timing of signal's
				  visualisation to prevent beat (throbbing) effect between sweep of computer's monitor,
				  sweep of oscilloscope's beams and ranked timing of samples output through
				  'ShowNext' function.
GridRefreshDivider=41		- How frequently grid has to be refreshed. This value defines number of horizontal beam's
				  full screen sweep passes after which grid restoring starts.
EventsProcDivider=1000		- This property created for lazy people calling to 'ShowNext' function of the library
				  directly from the thread of the main window of program.
				  This value defines amount of calling to 'ShowNext' function after which starts
				  a 'ProcessMessages' algorithm.
				  'ProcessMessages' permits the application to process messages that are currently
				  in the message queue. ProcessMessages cycles the Windows message loop until
				  it is empty, and then returns control to the 'ShowNext' function.
				  Note: Neglecting message processing affects only the application calling
				  ProcessMessages, not other applications. In lengthy operations, calling
				  ProcessMessages periodically allows the application to respond other messages.
				  Note: ProcessMessages does not allow the application to go idle,
				  whereas 'HandleMessage' Windows API function does.
				  If this value is zero - 'ProcessMessages' algorithm works never.
GridCellPixelsSize=40		- Defines geometrical size of grid's cells in pixels of screen. From 10 to 150.
				  Cells are always square.

ExtrnTriggerLevel=0.00		- Same like 'FirstTriggerLevel' but for external trigger signal input.
TriggerSource=0			- It defines the signal source for trigger. If it is 0 (zero) then trigger source
				  first beam is 1 - second beam, 2 - third beam and 3 - external trigger signal input.
TimeSamplesPerCell=20.0		- This is horizontal (time) scale. The value shows amount of signal's samples
				  per one horizontal step of screen grid - per one cell of this grid.
				  This is reading on start of oscilloscope and tending to nearest standard value
				  of horizontal coordinate scale.
Beam0VertScale=20.0		- This is vertical (amplitude) scale of first beam. This value shows amplitude
				  dimensionality (scaling factor) of one vertical step of screen grid - one cell
				  of this grid.
Beam1VertScale=20.0		- Same like 'Beam0VertScale', but for second beam.
Beam2VertScale=20.0		- Same like 'Beam0VertScale', but for third beam.
Beam0VertOffset=0.0		- This is vertical (amplitude) offset of zero base for first beam from middle of
				  oscilloscope's screen height.

				  Point of origin is upper left corner of computer screen.
ScopeFormLeft=108		- Computer screen's horizontal coordinate of left side of scope's form (window)
				  in pixels of the screen.
ScopeFormHeight=580		- Scope's form (window) height in pixels of computer screen.
ScopeFormWidth=765		- Scope's form (window) width in pixels of computer screen.
ScopeStayOnTop=0		- If it is not zero then scope's form (window) always stays in front of other windows 
				  In this mode scope's window does not submit to 'ScopeFormTop' and 'ScopeFormLeft' fields.
ScopeShowHints=0		- If it is not zero then scope shows hints about purpose of its visual control components.
ShowTriggerControls=1		- if it is zero - hides all trigger's controls, otherwise does not.
ShowOscJaggies=0		- If it is zero, the beam is plotted by connecting the signal discreet points with
				  a single line segment (first order interpolation). If it is not zero, the adjacent
				  beam points are connected by vertical & horizontal segments, thus displaying
				  the beam in "steps" for better viewing of samples.
ShowOscHexVal=0			- If this is not zero - then the 'VALUE' text field of scope's GUI has
				  hexadecimal representation.
ShowHexCheckBox=1		- If this is not zero - then 'Hex.' check box of scope's GUI is visible.
				  If it is zero then 'VALUE' text field has decimal with fractional value representation.
				  If it is not zero - 'VALUE' text field has hexadecimal integer representation.
ScopeShowAutoSweep=0		- If it is not zero - the form of scope shows 'Auto sweep' check box trigger control.
ScopeAutoSweep=0		- If it is not zero and 'ScopeShowAutoSweep' field is not zero and 'Auto sweep' check box
				  is enabled then, trigger works in the auto sweep mode.
ScopeAutoSweepDivider=4		- Decimation factor for auto sweep mode. Note that oscilloscope does not show
				  all samples of signal in the auto sweep trigger mode. However, all signal samples
				  will be saved in scope’s buffers
ScopeInputDumpSize=32000	- Defines stage of oscilloscope's input dumping buffer.
				  If it is 0 (zero or negative value) - then oscilloscope does not have any input
				  dumping buffer, otherwise this field defines length of dumping buffer and
				  'ShowNext' & 'ExternalNext' functions work through dumping buffer.
				  Presence of this buffer does not reduce performance of oscilloscope, but solves
				  time - critical situations. If this value is more than zero and less than 32000 - then
				  dumping buffer length will be stated as 32000.

[Miscellaneous]			- Section containing miscellaneous properties of oscilloscope's instance.
ReadDelayPerSample=0		- Delay in mS. for one sample of signal reading from file and showing in the oscilloscope.

  The functional purpose of the visual interface elements of oscilloscope.

   The window (form) of oscilloscope contains a group of standard elements.
   These and only these elements are the oscilloscope’s interface elements.

   The most graphical field having grid is the main oscilloscope’s screen.
   All channel beams are downloaded here.

   Vertical column of numbers is the additional graphical field, displaying the textual
   information concerning the vertical (amplitude) signal scale and offset.

   Textual field, found on the upper left corner of oscilloscope's screen
   displays horizontal sample signal resolution in one cell of the main oscilloscope's
   graphical field's marking grid. In other words, it displays the horizontal sweep speed.

   Panel located under oscilloscope's graphical field contains all oscilloscope's
   managing elements. Our continuing description refers to elements contained on this panel.

   Buttons with black vertical arrows - vertical zoom management.
   Vertical zoom management is available with the aid of vertical ruler field as well:
   move mouse pointer on vertical ruler field, press and hold right mouse button depressed
   and move mouse pointer vertically. 

   Buttons with black horizontal arrows - horizontal zoom management.

   Button with '0' (zero) - attributing the vertical scale zero point to the middle
   height of the main graphic field. 

   Buttons with red diagonal arrows - changes the geometrical size of the main graphical
   field grid cells (vertically as well as horizontally).

   Buttons with red vertical arrows - rolls (shift) the vertical scale and signal up & down.
   Vertical rolling management is available with the aid of vertical ruler field as well:
   move mouse pointer at vertical ruler field, press and hold left mouse button depressed
   and move mouse pointer vertically. Can use mouse’s scroll wheel.

   Buttons with red horizontal arrows - rolls (shift) the signal horizontally.
   Can be done by depressing “shift” or “control” buttons and rotating mouse’s scroll wheel. 

   Button with picture of hand points to scale - search for the beam. Shifts the vertical
   scale & the beam, placing the last beam sample in the middle of graphical field height.
   Works for all beams, changing from one to the other with every click of the button.

   Button with picture of magnifying glass - returns to the previous vertical & horizontal
   zoom scales which are changed by selecting & enlarging of the main graphical field section
   by pressing on the right mouse-button.

   Textual field 'VALUE:' - textual field designed to obtain the instantaneous value of the
   channel's amplitude while moving the mouse cursor in the main graphical field.
   Deduces the signal amplitude value in the moment of time corresponding to the horizontal
   mouse's cursor position in the oscilloscope graphical field.
   It is possible to switch it to other beams by double clicking mouse’s left button.
   Check 'Hex.' check box for hexadecimal value representation.

   'Jaggies' check box - changes the graphical style of the beams' representation.
   If this element is not selected, the beam is plotted by connecting the signal’s discreet
   points with a single line segment (first order interpolation). If this element is enacted,
   the adjacent beam points are connected by vertical & horizontal segments, thus displaying
   the beam in "steps" for better viewing of samples.

  'Trigger' button puts the oscilloscope in the trigger mode. In this mode the next
   horizontal sweep cycle occurs only if the front of the first beam crosses the
   amplitude level determined in the textual field on the right of this button.
   Current mode of trigger shown by picture on this button: if it is diagonal cross - the trigger
   is disabled, if it is an image of rising edge with arrow directed upwards - the trigger
   works on positive (rising) slope of signal, if it is an image of falling edge with arrow
   directed downwardss - the trigger works on negative (falling) slope of signal.

   'for Beam N' or 'for External' button defines the signal source for trigger.

   'Manual' check box - It's selection determines the manual trigger set mode - i.e.
   only with a single horizontal sweep cycle & only after clicking the 'Wait for next...' button.
   In the manual mode 'Wait for next...' button will be disabled until event of trigger
   does not happen.

   'Auto sweep' check box (can be invisible) - is trigger's mode control also.
   Selection of this check box brings oscilloscope into auto sweep trigger mode.
   Note that oscilloscope shows not all samples of signal in this trigger mode.
   However, all signal samples will be saved in scope’s buffers
   
   'ScopeAutoSweepDivider' field of ini. file defines decimation factor for auto sweep mode.
   The auto sweep mode works in the next style: If trigger did not work out on it's predefined
   event during predefined amount of signal samples - then oscilloscope runs one horizontal
   sweep screen pass and then comes back to waiting stage until trigger's event or until
   next expiration of amount of unshown signal samples.
   Amount of unshown signal samples defined as product of value of 'ScopeAutoSweepDivider'
   field of ini. file and amount of samples per one screen pass for current horizontal
   scale of oscilloscope. Auto sweep trigger mode only works if 'Auto sweep' check box
   is visible, enabled and checked.

   Note that ALL signal's samples are recorded in oscilloscope's buffers without data loss
   (omission) in ALL trigger's modes. This means that REAL signal's data sequence will be
   restored on the screen after repainting of signal's beams by any of oscilloscope's controls.


   'Beams' button commutes screen control (buttons with arrows and so on) between beams.
   If this button has caption 'Beams' - then control connected to all visible beams.
   Pressing on this button will change caption to 'Beam 0', next pressing - to 'Beam 1',
   next - to 'Beam 2' and next - again to 'Beams'. Screen control will work for beam having
   same number as caption: first beam is controlled if caption is 'Beam 0', second -
   if caption is 'Beam 1', third - if caption is 'Beam 2'.
   Graphical field, displaying the textual info concerning the vertical (amplitude)
   signal scale will change color of digits in accordance with color of currently
   controlled beam. Offset and zoom of this vertical scale will bring conformity with
   currently controlled beam. If this button has stage 'Beams', but offsets and/or zoom
   of beams are different, then vertical scale will show parameters for first beam.
   It is very easy to bring all beams to same offset and zoom: when button has
   stage 'Beams' press 'Zero' (0) button.
   If this button has stage 'Beams', and offsets and zoom of beams are equal - 
   then vertical scale will apply to digits color described in the 'INI' file
   in the section [Oscilloscope] (taking into account suffix)
   in the field 'OscVrulGenFontColor'.
   Switching by 'Beams' button has no effect on:
   textual field 'VALUE:',
   'Trigger' button and it's textual field,
   textual field of horizontal scale,
   buttons of horizontal zoom management,
   buttons of horizontal rolling management,
   'STEPS' check box,
   and button with picture of magnifying glass.
   Double click of left mouse button when mouse pointer is located on vertical scale
   ruler will gives same effect like pressing on 'Beams' button.

   'Disconnect' button located in lower right corner of oscilloscope's form.
   This button disconnects oscilloscope from data stream going through 'ShowNext'
   DLL exported function. 'ShowNext' function does not affect calling external process.
   'ShowNext' function just gives a work-out like dummy (empty) function - does nothing.
   After disconnection oscilloscope obtains any additional abilities which
   are not allowed in the online mode: select gap of signal using left button of mouse,
   copy selected gap of signal onto clipboard (as text) or save it to text file,
   select file and read it onto oscilloscope's screen, select area of oscilloscope's
   screen for zoom using right button of mouse, to measure of oscilloscope graphical
   performance (if field ShowTestButton=1 in 'INI' file.). Recurring pressure to
   this button will not allow additional abilities and will bring oscilloscope into
   online mode again.

   'Menu' button is enabled when oscilloscope disconnected from data stream.
   Opens main menu of oscilloscope.

   'Read from file' button is enabled when oscilloscope disconnected from data stream
   and file for reading selected by means of 'Open file...' menu item.
   Note that just selecting file for reading will not initiate reading of the file.
   In this situation full path and name of selected file will placed on the caption
   of oscilloscope's form.
   Pressing on 'Read from file' button will clear oscilloscope's signal buffers and
   will begin reading selected file and loading read data into lines of beams.
   Special slowing down of this output is possible through 'ReadDelayPerSample' filed
   in [Miscellaneous] (with suffix) section in the 'INI' file.
   Stated parameter of this field in mS. for one sample of signal.
   Recurring pressure on this button will clear oscilloscope's signal buffers and
   reread file again.

   'Test/Performance' button is visible if 'ShowTestButton' filed in the [Oscilloscope]
   (with suffix) section in the 'INI' file is 1 (one).
   This button is enabled when oscilloscope disconnected from data stream.
   Runs measurement of graphical operating speed for 10 - 20 seconds. Shows results
   of test in opening dialog window.
